#Two Sum Problem
HashMAp Approach: It uses the hash Table to store the indices of each integer in the array,for each integer first we calculate the complement
and then checks that if it is exist in the hash table or not.
if it does,we return the indices of the two integers as an array.


Problem :Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Solution:Python3 Code of Two Sum From Leetcode.
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        prevMap ={} 
        for i,n in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - n
            if diff in prevMap:
                return[prevMap[diff],i]
            prevMap[n]=i
        return
